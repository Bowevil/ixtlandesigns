## Sensitivity Analysis: What Matters Most?

### What if you already have a WordPress site?

The migration cost is real, but typically recovers quickly:
- Small site migration: $1,500-3,500
- Medium site migration: $5,000-10,000
- Large site migration: $12,000-25,000+

**Break-even analysis:**
- Small business: Savings cover migration cost in ~3 months
- Medium business: Savings cover migration cost in ~3-6 months
- Large organization: Savings cover migration cost in ~6-12 months

After break-even, you're saving thousands per year.

### What if you only care about hosting costs?

Even if you ignore maintenance time, Hugo saves:
- **$240-600/year** on hosting alone
- **Over 5 years: $1,200-3,000**

This alone justifies migration for performance-conscious organizations.

### What if you value your time at $200/hour?

WordPress maintenance time becomes expensive:
- **$10,800-21,600/year** just in maintenance labor
- With this calculation, Hugo saves **$8,000-20,000/year**

---

## Hidden Costs We Haven't Discussed

### WordPress Hidden Costs:

1. **Performance issues** - Slow sites lose customers (conversion impact: $1,000s)
2. **Downtime** - WordPress sites can go down (lost sales, brand damage)
3. **Security breaches** - Average cost: $4.29 million (IBM, 2023)
4. **Compliance** - GDPR/HIPAA compliance is harder with WordPress
5. **Scalability** - As traffic grows, WordPress becomes expensive to scale
6. **Lock-in** - Migrating off WordPress to something else is costly

### Hugo Advantages:

1. **Better SEO** - Fast sites rank better (more organic traffic)
2. **Higher conversions** - Fast sites convert better (3-5% improvement typical)
3. **No breach risk** - Static sites eliminate entire categories of risk
4. **Easy export** - Content is plain text, never locked in
5. **Scales for free** - Static files scale infinitely without cost
6. **Portability** - Can switch hosting with zero work

## Return on Investment (ROI)

### Best Case: Small Nonprofit

- Annual savings: $15,000
- Migration cost: $2,500
- Year 1 ROI: **500%**
- Break-even: **1 month**

### Typical Case: Growing Business

- Annual savings: $20,000
- Migration cost: $7,500
- Year 1 ROI: **167%**
- Break-even: **4.5 months**

### Complex Case: Large Organization

- Annual savings: $25,000
- Migration cost: $18,500
- Year 1 ROI: **35%**
- Break-even: **8.9 months**

**In every scenario, migration pays for itself in less than a year.**

## Conclusion

The numbers are clear: **Hugo is dramatically cheaper than WordPress over time.**
