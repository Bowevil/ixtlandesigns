## Cardistry Meets Technology

Ion Rot is a custom-built display system designed specifically for cardistry artists. We're creating an interactive platform that lets you showcase your best flourishes and springs in a way that captures their fluidity and artistry.

## What We're Building

A customizable display system that:

- **Showcases your skills** - Beautiful, fluid video presentations of your cardistry
- **Connects artists** - Build a community around cardistry
- **Tells your story** - Share your journey and inspire others
- **Supports creators** - Tools designed by and for the cardistry community

## Get Involved

We're actively developing this platform and want to include the community in the process.

- **Testing** new features
- **Sharing feedback** as we build
- **Supporting the vision** of a cardistry-first platform
