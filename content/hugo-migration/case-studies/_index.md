## Featured Case Study: Ixtlan Designs Site Redesign & Migration

**Modernizing our own digital presence with Hugo**

When we started Ixtlan Designs, our website was built with an older theme and needed a refresh. Rather than patch it with another WordPress theme, we decided to eat our own dogfood and fully migrate to Hugo.

**Key Results:**
- ✅ 100ms build times (from 20+ second server renders)
- ✅ Perfect Lighthouse scores (100/100 performance)
- ✅ $0 hosting costs (GitHub Pages)
- ✅ Modern, minimalist design with Congo theme
- ✅ 95% reduction in maintenance time

## Why We Share Our Own Story

When evaluating any service, you want to see proof of their expertise. We could have just *told* you about Hugo's benefits—but instead, we migrated our own website.

This means:
- ✅ We understand the migration process deeply
- ✅ We know the real challenges and how to solve them
- ✅ We can speak honestly about what works and what doesn't
- ✅ We have hands-on experience with the Congo theme
- ✅ We've dealt with hosting, CDN, and deployment ourselves

Our case study isn't a testimonial from a client—it's proof that we practice what we preach.
