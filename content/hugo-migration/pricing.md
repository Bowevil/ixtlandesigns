## Pricing Questions & Examples

### How do you determine the final price within each tier?

Pricing depends on:
- **Content volume** - More pages take longer to migrate and optimize
- **Site complexity** - Custom functionality costs more than standard pages
- **Design requirements** - Basic theme vs. fully custom design
- **Integrations needed** - APIs, forms, e-commerce, etc.
- **Your team's technical level** - More training needed = higher cost

### Example: Professional Tier Breakdown

**Client: Growing Nonprofit (60 pages, needs custom design, wants CDN)**

- Content migration (60 pages): 12 hours @ $125/hr = $1,500
- Theme customization & design: 20 hours @ $125/hr = $2,500
- Content optimization & SEO: 8 hours @ $125/hr = $1,000
- Hosting setup (GitHub + CloudFront + DNS): 6 hours @ $125/hr = $750
- Training and launch support: 6 hours @ $125/hr = $750
- **Total: ~$6,500** (within Professional tier of $5,000-10,000)

### What's NOT included?

We don't include:
- Content writing or rewriting (beyond formatting)
- Photography or graphic design

We can recommend partners for these services, or we can provide estimates for incorporating them into your project.

### Do you offer payment plans?

Yes. For larger projects, we can arrange:
- 50% upfront, 50% on completion
- Phased payments tied to project milestones
- Custom arrangements for long-term support contracts

### What if the migration is more complex than expected?

We provide a detailed assessment before starting, so surprises are rare. If additional complexity emerges during the project:
- We'll discuss it with you immediately
- We'll provide a revised estimate
- We'll only proceed with your approval
- We never surprise you with unexpected charges

### How do you handle scope creep?

Our process includes:
- Detailed upfront assessment and scope definition
- Clear statement of what's included
- Regular communication about progress
- Any out-of-scope requests get a separate estimate

This keeps costs predictable and prevents surprises.
