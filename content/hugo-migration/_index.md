## Is Your WordPress Site Costing Too Much?

Your website is critical to your business, but WordPress, Drupal, and other traditional CMS platforms come with significant hidden costs: expensive hosting, endless plugin maintenance, security vulnerabilities, and slow performance.

**What if there was a better way?**

Hugo offers a modern alternative that's **10x faster**, **90% cheaper to operate**, and dramatically more secure. We specialize in migrating websites from expensive CMS platforms to Hugo—and we've done it for our own agency.

## The Problem with Traditional CMS Platforms

### 💰 Expensive Hosting
- WordPress hosting: $200-500/month
- Complicated scaling requirements
- Database maintenance costs
- Regular security patches (reactive)

### 🐌 Poor Performance
- Slow page loads (2-5+ seconds)
- Database queries on every request
- Bloated plugin ecosystems
- High bandwidth usage

### 🔓 Security Concerns
- Vulnerable plugins and themes
- Constant update cycle
- Exposed admin panels
- Database breach risks

### 😫 High Maintenance
- Plugin conflicts and compatibility issues
- Regular updates breaking functionality
- Complex backup strategies
- Ongoing developer time required

---

## The Hugo Solution

### ⚡ Lightning-Fast Performance
**100ms builds. Perfect Lighthouse scores. Sub-second page loads.**

Hugo generates static HTML files—no database queries, no server processing. Your site loads instantly for every visitor, every time.

- Median page load time: **< 1 second** (vs. 2-5+ seconds for WordPress)
- Lighthouse performance score: **95-100** (vs. 40-60 for WordPress)
- Bandwidth usage: **90% reduction**

### 💰 Dramatically Lower Costs
**$0-50/month vs. $200-500/month for WordPress**

Static sites are cheap to host. GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel cost nothing. CloudFront CDN adds global distribution for pennies.

- Hosting: **$0-50/month** (vs. $200-500)
- No plugin licenses: **$0** (vs. $100-1000+/year)
- Maintenance: **minimal** (vs. 5-10 hours/month)
- **Annual savings: $2,400-5,400+**

### 🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security
**No database to hack. No plugins to exploit. No admin panel to breach.**

Static sites are inherently secure—there's nothing to attack.

- No database vulnerabilities
- No plugin exploits
- No admin panel exposure
- No server compromise risks

### 🚀 Modern Tech Stack
**Built on open standards. Future-proof. Developer-friendly.**

- Version control everything (Git)
- Modern templating languages
- Flexible content organization
- Unlimited customization

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Hugo right for my site?

Hugo works great for:
- Marketing websites
- Blogs and publications
- Documentation sites
- Portfolios and case studies
- Nonprofits and small businesses
- Company intranets

Hugo is less suitable for:
- Sites with thousands of daily updates (better served by traditional CMS)
- Complex real-time features (better served by web apps)
- Sites requiring collaborative content editing (though solutions exist)

**We'll be honest about whether Hugo fits your needs. Not every site is a good fit—and we'll tell you if yours isn't.**

### What about hosting?

Hugo sites can be hosted on:
- **GitHub Pages** - Free, perfect for most sites
- **Netlify** - Free tier, excellent for most use cases
- **Vercel** - Fast edge hosting, great for high traffic
- **CloudFront** - Global CDN for premium performance
- **Your own server** - If you prefer self-hosting

Most clients use GitHub Pages or Netlify and pay nothing for hosting.

### Can we move from WordPress to Hugo?

**Absolutely.** We handle:
- All page and post content
- Images and media assets
- URL redirects (so you don't lose SEO)
- Custom post types and taxonomies
- Comments (if needed)

The process is straightforward and we manage all the technical details.

### What about editing content?

Hugo's content is plain text files in Git. You can edit them:
- **Directly in your text editor** - Simple and powerful
- **Via GitHub's web interface** - Easy for non-developers
- **With a headless CMS** - If you want a WordPress-like admin interface
- **With a visual editor** - Tools like Forestry or Decap CMS

Most of our clients find Git + their editor the simplest approach—but we can set up whatever works best for your team.

### What if I need custom functionality?

Hugo is incredibly flexible. We can:
- Create custom data structures
- Build complex site architectures
- Integrate with APIs and external services
- Add forms, contact submissions, and analytics
- Build internal tools for content management

If you can dream it, we can build it in Hugo.

### How long does migration take?

- **Small sites (< 25 pages):** 2-3 weeks
- **Medium sites (25-100 pages):** 4-6 weeks
- **Large sites (100+ pages or custom features):** 8-12 weeks

The exact timeline depends on your content volume, complexity, and custom requirements. We provide a detailed assessment and timeline estimate upfront.

### Do you provide ongoing support?

Yes. All our services include post-launch support:
- **Starter:** 30 days included
- **Professional:** 90 days + 3 months monthly support
- **Enterprise:** 6-12 month contract

We also offer:
- **Monthly support plans** - $300-1,000/month
